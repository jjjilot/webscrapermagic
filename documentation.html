        <h1>I coded the "magic" in between and around the input and output. My code takes the amount of time the user wants to wait in between each scrape and makes sure it's at least 20 seconds. It then waits that amount of time and retrieves the page's contents from the input. It compares these contents to the page's old contents. If they're the same it waits the determined time but if they're different it sends the new content and the amount of time since the last change to the output. </h1>
